--- Interaction 1 ---
 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
Development tasks are defined by identifying what needs to be built to implement each user story. This includes activities such as coding, testing, design, documentation, integration, and deployment. Each user story has specific tasks associated with it to ensure the desired functionality is implemented effectively.
Worker Agent Response:
Exactly, development tasks are crucial in breaking down user stories into actionable items that need to be completed to deliver the desired functionality. These tasks typically include coding the necessary features, testing to ensure they work as intended, designing any new components, documenting the changes made, integrating the new code with existing systems, and deploying the updates to production. By defining these tasks, development teams can effectively plan and execute the work required to implement each user story.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the answer provided does not meet the criteria. The answer does not follow the specific structure outlined, including Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the incorrect answer, follow these steps:

1. Add the Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies to the answer.
2. Ensure that the answer follows the specific structure outlined for each section.
3. Double-check that the information provided aligns with the requirements and expectations for the task.
4. Make any necessary revisions or additions to the answer to meet the criteria.
5. Review the answer to ensure it is complete and accurate before submitting it for evaluation.
 Step 5: Send feedback to worker agent for refinement

Worker Agent Response:
Task ID: 001
Task Title: Implement User Authentication
Related User Story: As a user, I want to be able to log in to the application to access my personalized content.
Description: Develop the functionality to allow users to create an account, log in with their credentials, and securely authenticate their identity.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can register with a valid email address and password.
- Users can log in using their registered credentials.
- Passwords are securely stored and encrypted.
Estimated Effort: 8 hours
Dependencies: User Interface Design, Database Setup

By defining this task, the development team can effectively plan and execute the work required to implement the user authentication feature in alignment with the user story.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
Yes, this answer meets the criteria as it follows the exact structure provided. It includes a unique Task ID, a brief Task Title, a reference to the Related User Story, a detailed Description of the technical work required, specific Acceptance Criteria, an Estimated Effort, and Dependencies.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
âœ… Final solution accepted.
Executing step: Development tasks for a product are derived from the user stories identified in the product spec. Each user story has specific tasks associated with it to implement the desired functionality. The development tasks typically include activities such as coding, testing, design, documentation, integration, and deployment.
