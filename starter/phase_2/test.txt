 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
To create a development plan with a timeline that includes all the development tasks for the product, we need to start by identifying the specific development tasks required to implement each user story. This involves breaking down each user story into smaller, more manageable tasks that can be assigned to developers. Once we have a list of all the development tasks, we can estimate the time required to complete each task and create a timeline for the entire development process. This timeline should take into account dependencies between tasks and allocate resources accordingly to ensure timely completion of the product.
